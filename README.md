SMART COOLING SYSTEM:

Read the room temperature using an appropriate sensor, then turn on a fan or air conditioner when the temperature exceeds 30o
Display the read temperature on an LCD.
Add an ‘automatic turnoff’ option where the fan or air conditioner is automatically turned OFF after a specific time interval.
